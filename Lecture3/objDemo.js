// How can you represent real-world objects in code?
// They have associated attributes = object PROPERTIES
// They have associated actions = object METHOD
// They have associated context = "this"

// First:
// Let's define a simple object (with no properties or method)
const blank = {};
console.log("Blank type:,typeof blank");
console.log("Blank value",blank);

/*
// Next:
// Let's define an object with PROPERTIES (attributes)
// objects are just a coolection of name-value pairs
// separated by commas
